About the Project :

These C programs are designed for beginners to practice fundamental programming concepts like arithmetic operations, temperature conversion, input/output, and simple logic handling in C.

Arithmetic Operations :

The arithmetic program allows users to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and then performs it on two user-provided numbers.

Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion :

This program converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = C*9/5+32

Files Included :

arithmetic.c - The C program file for performing arithmetic operations.

celsius_to_fahrenheit.c - The C program file for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit.

README.md - This README file.

Getting Started :

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

Prerequisites

You need a C compiler to run these programs. You can install GCC as follows:

Windows: Download and install MinGW.

MacOS: Install Xcode command-line tools with xcode-select --install.

Linux: Install GCC with the following command:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential

Installation

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-repository-name

Usage

Running Arithmetic Operations Program

1. Compile the arithmetic.c file:

gcc arithmetic.c -o arithmetic

2. Run the program:

./arithmetic

3. Follow the prompts to choose an operation and input numbers.

Running Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion Program

1. Compile the celsius_to_fahrenheit.c file:

gcc celsius_to_fahrenheit.c -o celsius_to_fahrenheit

2. Run the program:

./celsius_to_fahrenheit

3. Enter the Celsius temperature when prompted to see the Fahrenheit result.

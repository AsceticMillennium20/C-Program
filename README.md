About the Project :

These C programs are designed for beginners to practice fundamental programming concepts like arithmetic operations, temperature conversion, input/output, and simple logic handling in C.

Arithmetic Operations :

The arithmetic program allows users to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and then performs it on two user-provided numbers.

Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion :

This program converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = C*9/5+32

Leap Year Checker :

This repository contains C programs that determine whether a given year is a leap year. The program accepts both numeric and alphabetic inputs.

Alphabet or Numeric Checker : This repository contains a C program that determines whether the given input is an alphabet (A-Z, a-z) or a numeric digit (0-9).

Files Included :

arithmetic.c - The C program file for performing arithmetic operations.

celsius_to_fahrenheit.c - The C program file for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit.

leapyear.c - The C program file for finding the leap year.

alphabet.c - The C program file for finding the input is numeric or alphabet.

README.md - This README file.

Getting Started :

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

Prerequisites

You need a C compiler to run these programs. You can install GCC as follows:

Windows: Download and install MinGW.

MacOS: Install Xcode command-line tools with xcode-select --install.

Linux: Install GCC with the following command:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
